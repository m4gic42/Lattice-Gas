# Reticular-Gas
Simulation of a reticular gas using diifferent models and conditions in JAVA.


This repository contains three scripts that display different visualisations based on the same traditional simulation of a reticular gas:

-In the firts the particles have a radius and a velocity and they can't bump into each other, this simulation begins very slow with small particles;
-In the second each particle is represented by a single pixel, making the rendering of small particles much faster;
-The third is an extension of the first script to 3D rendering.


Of the first two of the scripts exist two versions: one with Fixed Boundaries Conditions (FBC) and the other one with Periodic Boundaries Conditions (PBC).

Hope it could be useful and comment for any question or suggestion.
